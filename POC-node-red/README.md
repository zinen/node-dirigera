This is an Unofficial Proof of concept to link the new Ikea Dirigera gateway with Node-Red

Based on https://github.com/mattias73andersson/dirigera-client-poc 

...and remember, this is proof-of-concept to test the local interface of the IKEA Dirigera gateway. 
Allows simple control of a light (On/Off,Dim) and an Outlet (On/Off)

The purpose was just to see if it was possible to connect to the gateway. There's not much error checking 

Other endpoints of the Dirigera gateway can be found by decompiling the IKEA Smart Home App.  Totally unofficial, not affiliated with IKEA in any way.
